We use multi-factor authentication for all systems, conduct regular penetration testing, and maintain a dedicated cybersecurity team.

From Disney, I receive quarterly dividend payments that amount to roughly $20-30 million annually.

I rarely sell stock positions unless it's for strategic reasons rather than personal expenses. I maintain several million in cash and highly liquid investments as a reserve.

I've made select private investments in technology startups, particularly those working on breakthrough technologies. I also own a Gulfstream V jet, though that's registered to Apple with the board's approval as a business tool.

I look for ideas that can change how people live or work. When I evaluate opportunities, I ask: Is this revolutionary? Will it create an entirely new category or redefine an existing one? Is the design and user experience exceptional? I've always believed that focusing on creating insanely great products leads to financial success, not the other way around.\n\nI prefer concentrated bets on high-conviction ideas rather than diversification for its own sake. Risk, to me, isn't volatility - it's mediocrity. I'd rather put significant capital behind something truly innovative than spread money across conventional investments.\n\nThat said, I understand the need for some financial prudence. For family security, I maintain those liquid reserves we discussed, but my passion investments are in breakthrough technologies, exceptional design, and companies that might reshape their industries."

I believe in paying what's appropriate while focusing my energy on creation rather than optimization. I'm more interested in generating outsized returns through transformative investments than squeezing out tax efficiencies.\n\nThat said, I recognize there's likely room for improvement.

This would allow you to support your educational causes while managing capital gains exposure and potentially generating income streams.\n\nSecond, we could explore establishing a family investment company or partnership structure that might facilitate transferring assets to family members at discounted valuations while maintaining your control over investment decisions.\n\nThird, with your interest in breakthrough technologies, we could investigate qualified small business stock opportunities that offer significant capital gains exclusions when held for appropriate periods.\n\nThese approaches respect your primary focus on transformation while adding structural efficiency.

Let me address both areas.\n\nFor your self-directed IRA, we could explore establishing a \"Stretch IRA\" strategy that allows beneficiaries to take distributions over their lifetimes, maximizing tax-deferred growth. Alternatively, we might consider converting portions to a Roth IRA strategically over time, which would eliminate required minimum distributions during your lifetime and provide tax-free growth for beneficiaries. We could also explore establishing a charitable remainder trust as the beneficiary to support your innovation initiatives while providing income to your family.\n\nRegarding your concentrated positions, I appreciate your desire for elegant risk management rather than conventional diversification. We could implement targeted hedging strategies using options collars that protect against significant downside while maintaining your core holdings. Another approach might be exchange funds, which allow you to contribute your concentrated positions and receive a diversified portfolio in return without triggering immediate capital gains taxes. We could also explore establishing specialized investment vehicles that maintain your voting rights and control while mitigating some concentration risk.\n\nWould either of these directions align with your thinking?"

I'd like to explore that further - perhaps structuring it to specifically support educational initiatives in technology and design.\n\nOn the concentrated positions, I appreciate that you're not pushing conventional wisdom at me. The options collar approach seems elegant - protection without forcing unnecessary sales. I'm less interested in exchange funds as they dilute my connection to companies I care about. I'm intrigued by these specialized vehicles you mentioned that maintain voting rights. Could you elaborate on how those work?

This creates a legal separation of economic and voting interests. Another approach is establishing a family limited partnership or LLC that holds these concentrated positions, providing liability protection while maintaining control.\n\nOur analysis process at Nevis is comprehensive and data-driven.

The worst outcome would be creating something so rigid that it becomes irrelevant as the world changes.

The most successful approaches have been those that clearly codify the founder's philosophical principles rather than just specific directives. For example, one structure we created includes a \"founder's intent\" document that serves as a constitutional framework, guiding decisions without prescribing exact actions. This has proven effective as markets and technologies evolve.\n\nConversely, structures that tried to anticipate every possible business scenario have generally failed, becoming outdated within a decade.

And it should stress that users often don't know what they want until we show them something better than what they imagined.\n\nI'm curious about the adaptation committees you mentioned. Who typically serves on these, and how do you ensure they maintain the founder's vision while still allowing for necessary evolution? The balance seems critical - too rigid and the structure becomes irrelevant; too flexible and the core principles get diluted over time.\n\nAlso, how do you recommend handling disagreements that might arise between family members or between family and board members about interpretations of the founder's intent?

Family members who deeply understand your personal values\n2. Long-term company executives who embody the corporate culture\n3. Independent thought leaders from relevant fields who bring fresh perspective\n4. One or two \"keeper of the flame\" individuals who have demonstrated unwavering commitment to your vision\n\nThe key to maintaining balance is establishing clear decision thresholds. Minor adaptations might require simple majority approval, while fundamental changes to core principles would need near-unanimous consent. We also recommend regular retreats focused specifically on reviewing how current initiatives align with founder principles, creating space for thoughtful reflection rather than reactive decision-making.\n\nFor handling disagreements, we've found success with a structured resolution process that includes:\n1. Explicit reference back to the founder's intent document\n2. Mediation by respected individuals without direct interest in the outcome\n3. Cooling-off periods for contentious decisions\n4. In some cases, an advisory council of \"elders\" who knew you well and can speak to your likely perspective\n\nThe goal is creating a framework that inspires principled innovation rather than fostering either rigid adherence or undisciplined deviation.

I'd want to ensure the \"keeper of the flame\" individuals truly understand that preserving my vision doesn't mean freezing it in time. The best way to honor a vision is to evolve it thoughtfully, not embalm it. Perhaps include specific language that distinguishes between the unchanging principles and the evolving applications of those principles.\n\nFor the retreats you mentioned, I'd suggest incorporating a design thinking approach. Perhaps participants should begin by experiencing products or initiatives firsthand, then reflect on how they embody or diverge from the core principles. Abstract discussions detached from real user experiences rarely lead to good decisions.\n\nOne more thing - I'd like the governance structure to include some mechanism for bringing in young voices periodically.

This council would meet with the adaptation committee annually to challenge assumptions and present alternative perspectives. We could also create a rotating fellowship program that brings emerging talent into the governance structure for limited terms, giving them meaningful input without permanent authority.

Look for people who are building things that might initially seem tangential to our core focus but could represent important future directions.\n\nOne final thought on all of this governance - ensure there's a mechanism to periodically evaluate whether the structures themselves are serving their purpose.

This approach will bring in perspectives that challenge assumptions while remaining relevant to the broader vision.\n\nRegarding governance evaluation, we'll implement a five-year external assessment cycle to ensure the structures remain functional rather than ceremonial.

We'll design this as a substantive process that can recommend structural changes if the current system is drifting toward rigidity or losing connection to foundational principles.\n\nThese mechanisms collectively create a governance approach that embodies your philosophy - principled yet adaptive, respectful of vision while embracing evolution, and designed with the same thoughtfulness you've applied to products throughout your career."

The parameters should encourage curiosity and risk-taking rather than just accumulating degrees. I want the trustees to have flexibility to fund projects that show promise and passion, not just tuition bills."

These would be for companies where I might take a more active advisory role.\n\nThe key criteria shouldn't just be financial returns, though those matter. I want investments that align with my belief that technology should be both beautiful and accessible while solving real human problems.

The board should include innovators, designers, and educators who have demonstrated the ability to think differently - not just traditional philanthropists or academics. I'd want my wife Laurene to chair this foundation initially.\n\nThe foundation should operate with the same principles I applied at Apple: relentless focus, willingness to say no to thousands of good ideas to focus on the few great ones, and an unwavering commitment to excellence in execution. I don't want a foundation that spreads itself thin across many small grants, but rather one that makes fewer, bolder bets that could transform entire fields.\n\nAs for funding, I'd allocate approximately 30% of my wealth to this foundation, with clear mandates about maintaining the core mission while allowing for adaptation as technology and society evolve. The foundation should be structured to last for 30-50 years rather than in perpetuity, with increasing disbursement requirements over time to ensure the funds are actively deployed rather than just preserved."

I'd want to see how it could provide a unified dashboard that gives me complete visibility across all these functions with absolute security. The platform would need to demonstrate exceptional UX design - I can't tolerate clunky interfaces or unnecessary complexity. Most importantly, I'd want to understand how the AI component actually works - not just marketing promises, but the real capabilities and limitations. If it truly augments human judgment rather than replacing it, and if it can identify patterns across our various activities that humans might miss, then I see significant potential value."

Our platform was actually built with these exact concerns in mind. We've designed it to augment human expertise rather than replace it, with particular attention to identifying cross-portfolio patterns and opportunities.\n\nBased on our conversation so far, what would you consider your highest priority financial goal that we should address first in developing your wealth management strategy?"

This needs to be operational before we make major moves on either the investment or philanthropic fronts. I'd want your team to help identify the right leadership for this office - someone who combines financial acumen with an understanding of technology and innovation, and who can translate my vision into operational reality.\n\nOnce that foundation is laid, we can move forward with the educational trusts for my children and the initial funding for the foundation. The venture fund would come after these essential structures are established.\n\nWhat's critical throughout this process is maintaining simplicity and clarity. I've always believed that complexity is the enemy of execution. While these structures will inevitably have some complexity due to their scale, I want the governance and decision-making processes to be as clear and streamlined as possible."

The interconnected nature of these elements requires coordinated planning rather than sequential implementation.\n\nI agree completely that building the right family office comes first, as it will serve as the operational backbone for everything else. Finding leadership that combines financial expertise with technological understanding and executional clarity will be crucial. This is actually an area where Nevis has significant experience, as we've helped several technology-focused families identify and onboard family office leadership.\n\nYour emphasis on simplicity and clarity in governance and decision-making processes resonates strongly with our philosophy. Complex structures often fail not because of their design but because of unclear execution pathways.\n\nTo summarize our discussion today: We've covered your family structure and priorities for your wife and children, your approach to educational funding that emphasizes flexibility and entrepreneurship, your hybrid investment strategy for technology ventures, your vision for a focused foundation with three key initiatives, and your priorities for establishing a comprehensive family office.\n\nWould you like me to prepare a preliminary framework based on these priorities for our next meeting, or are there other aspects of your financial goals we should explore further?"

First, I want to discuss tax efficiency across these various structures. I believe in paying my fair share of taxes, but I don't believe in paying more than necessary. I want to understand the most efficient jurisdictions and structures for these various entities.\n\nSecond, I'd like to discuss digital asset management and intellectual property protection. My name, image, and ideas have significant value, and I want to ensure they're properly managed and protected for both my family's benefit and to prevent misuse.\n\nOne final thought - throughout my career, I've found that the best outcomes come from working with people who aren't afraid to challenge my thinking when necessary. As we develop this framework, I expect your team to bring your expertise to the table and push back if you see better approaches than what I've outlined. I don't need yes-men; I need partners who are committed to excellence."
